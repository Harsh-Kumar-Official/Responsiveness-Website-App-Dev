# Responsiveness and javascript

This is Task 2 assigned by Banao Technology. In this task, I was asked to create a responsive website that is both desktop and mobile-friendly, incorporating the best scroll effects. I chose to build the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, opting not to use React in order to challenge myself and see how well I could design the website without it.
